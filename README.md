# homebuddySp19

## Getting started
For this project we will be using React to create our web app! If you do not have node/npm installed, click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)!

To run the web app, clone this repository on your terminal, and run:
```
cd homebuddySp19
npm start
```

Since we are going to be writing javascript code for our app, I recommend downloading Webstorm, which is essentially Intellij or Pycharm for javascript! However, since Webstorm is not usually free (it usually has a 30 day free trial), we are going to get a [JetBrains student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) using our Berkeley emails! Follow the instructions and create a JetBrains account.

After creating the account, we can download Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac). Once you have downloaded and started up Webstorm, click through everything until you reach the login page. At this point, log in using the JetBrains account that you just created, and you should now be able to use Webstorm to work on the app!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
